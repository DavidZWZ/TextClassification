[Tensor2Tensor](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor), or
[T2T](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor) for short, is a library
of deep learning models and datasets designed to make deep learning more
accessible and [accelerate ML
research](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/06/accelerating-deep-learning-research.html).
T2T is actively used and maintained by researchers and engineers within the
[Google Brain team](https://research.google.com/teams/brain/) and a community
of users. We're eager to collaborate with you too, so feel free to
[open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/issues)
or send along a pull request (see [our contribution doc](CONTRIBUTING.md)).
You can chat with us on
[Gitter](https://gitter.im/tensor2tensor/Lobby) and join the
[T2T Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tensor2tensor).
